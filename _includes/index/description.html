    <p class="card-text">This online exhibit is a collection of stories and folklore from various cultures around the world. It includes images, videos, text, and music. As you explore the various locations and narratives, think about the role they play in your understanding of the world. Would your world be the same if these environmental characters never played their part? Also, try to think about how connected these stories are despite their distance and relative context. Many stories exist as cautionary tales or feral gossip. They capture our imaginations and influence us. So, how have you encountered these stories, and how have they changed you? Or, if this is your first time hearing these stories, have they changed your world?
    
      The exhibit will start with various videos, text and images that explain the narrative and context of the story. Then, the exhibit will end with landscape photographs of the folklore's environmental setting. I encourage you to imagine yourself in those natural locations. What would it feel like, how would you react, and what is the world around you doing? Then, you can recognize that the environment has its own stories, and that we are only characters in theirs. The water, the trees, the air, the more-than-human beings all live lives with their own narratives; we just serve as minor characters in their stories. But, we all come together and interact with eachother to make these collective incredible and influential stories that wouldn't be the same without every character, be that human or more-than-human. Enjoy the exhibit and think about what other narratives you think should be included in this repository.</p>
