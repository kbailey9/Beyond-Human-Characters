## The Ending is just the Beginning

We’ve come to the end of this exhibition, but not the end of the story. Narratives are constantly invented and re-invented. They tell us messages of danger, warnings, and sometimes an escape from a negative reality. They can be metaphors for current society and show us how the future can look. They embrace imagination regardless of context. Just as these folkloric stories have many versions, more versions will arise. They connect us to our past and speak to us about lessons vital to us in the present.

Each part of a story is necessary. While we tend to focus on the protagonists and antagonists, there are also side and minor characters. And, who is to say all of these roles are human? The narratives of these stories are all inspired and dependent on the environmental character. The setting, the actions, and the interpretations are all made through interactions between human civilization, more-than-human animals, and nature itself. What is Pompeii without Mount Vesuvius? What are the Djinn without the desert? And, what is death without life? Folklore gives us cultural meanings and warnings about the world. The next time you encounter a story, think about how it would change if there were only humans in the narrative. We all all connected in such an entangled way that our very ancestral messages are viewed through nature. So, I hope you’ve enjoyed this look into the world of stories and that you look at the environment with a bit more respect for the role it plays in our lives.
