## The Bluestones of Stonehenge

The Bluestones of Stonehenge are a neolithic structure in England, however, the stones themselves came from Wales. Why move the stones across unforgiving landscapes, and how? Well, folklore provides some interesting stories on the matter. Archaeologists tell narratives of Neolithic celestial rituals and mass gatherings, but local legends tell a different story. A few of the stories have a first recorded date of about 2400 BC. It is said that in the story of King Arthur, Merlin was tasked to retrieve a circle of stones made by the Giants of Ireland called the Giantsâ€™ Dance. Then, Merlin used his knowledge and powers to uproot the stones, transport them by ship, and finally re-erect them in their current location as a warrior's burial ground marker. Archaeologists have found warriors buried on the site. This also leads to another story, the Amesbury Archer. His skeleton was found near Stonehenge with numerous arrowheads. He had various healed wounds alongside a broken rib and broken arm in addition to his wrecked knee. He has evidence of the first metal workings of the age, and had materials native to the Alps. His story shows that he was a wealthy warrior from the Alps region who traveled the whole distance to Stonehenge. Why? Well, local mythology and crystal researchers claim that the Preseli Bluestones have healing properties. Many believe that the Archer made the journey in hopes of healing his injuries. This is not the first instance of natural remedies for various health issues. Making a pilgrimage in hopes of mystical intervention is not unique either, even in the modern era. The Bluestones traveled a great distance to reside where they are today, and their legendary powers have attracted people since their construction. Would you make the journey in hopes of healing? Do they inspire you to believe, even if it is a long shot? Because that is the message they represent.
