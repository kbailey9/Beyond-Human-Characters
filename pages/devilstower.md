## The Devil's Tower

The Devil’s Tower is a massive geological structure rising from the earth in an otherwise flat landscape. Many Native American tribes hold narratives of Devil’s Tower, but let us get one thing straight: its name is Bear Lodge. Westerners misinterpreted the Native American language of the area from “Bear Lodge” to a phrase shortened to “Devil’s Tower” in the 1930s. The legend overall dates back centuries, with an estimate of around 1500 AD. There are many renditions of the story based on which tribe is telling it. One talks about how warriors fought a legendary bear, but a few talk about the seven sisters. One of the stories, from the Kiowa community, goes that several little girls were playing away from the village. When bears started hunting them, the girls ran back to the village. They jumped onto a low rock. One of the girls prayed to the rock to protect them, and the rock rose into the sky. The bears tried to climb after the girls, but only scratched the side of the rock, broke their claws, and fell. The rock continued to rise into the sky until it reached the stars. The seven girls became a little group of stars, the Pleiades, which appear over Bear Lodge in the winter. This story tells of how separation causes danger and how the environment can protect others. While mystical in nature, this is visible today. Many environmental features provide shelter, protection, and barriers from danger. So, next time you’re in danger, look to your surroundings to find protection.
