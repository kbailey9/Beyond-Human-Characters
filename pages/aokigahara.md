## The Aokigahara Forest

## Content Warning: Suicide and Death

Aokigahara Forest is also known as the Sea of Trees and the Demon Forest. Why? Well, from overhead, the trees continue for miles. Grown from the nutrient-rich volcanic ash from a previous Mount Fuji eruption in 864 AD, Aokigahara Forest is teeming with greenery and rare beings. But it is easy to get lost in the branches, especially if your goal is to get lost. In ancient times, Japanese communities practiced Ubasute, leaving elderly members in remote places to die, in the forest. In more recent history, Aokigahara has become a popular location for suicide. Many signs have been placed around the forest to discourage the populace from committing, and many guidelines have been placed around the wooded landscape to lead people back from the depths. Folklore has taken over the Aokigahara forest, after all, people tend to create stories to explain why so much death occurs in a singular location. Stories of Yurei, Japanese ghosts, and demons luring people into the forest are common in the woods. Many people theorize it is a popular suicide location because it is so natural. Aokigahara forest is close to Tokyo, a major metropolitan city. Removing oneself from concrete and technology to enjoy nature is often an encouraged action for citizens of cities. And, Aokigahara Forest is full of nature, so perhaps people find their eternal rest here to find peace in the woods. So, while the Sea of Trees comments on how the forest is so expansive and is a home to many creatures, the Demon Forest comments on its tendency toward death. Heed the warning signs of Aokigahara Forest; do not lose yourself to the trees. But remember that being removed from nature is just as bad as losing yourself to it.
