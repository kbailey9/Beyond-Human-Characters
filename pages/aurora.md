## Aurora Borealis

The Aurora Borealis has captivated the world since the beginning. What looks like a beautiful natural light show is caused by the solar wind hitting the Earth's magnetosphere. The reaction produces the dancing ribbons we find fascinating. The northern regions of the globe have numerous stories and explanations for the lights, many starting around 1000 BC. Many stories relate to spirits, whether ancestral or more-than-human, and even of a realm beyond our current world. The Inuit people tell a narrative of souls dancing in the lights. Some versions state that they carry torches to guide the living, while other stories are more playful. The Inuit term for the aurora is aksarnirq, meaning ball player in English. This is a fitting name because the legend goes that the souls of the dead, sometimes specified as children, are playing soccer in the sky with a walrus skull. The moving and twisting lights are the playing spirits. It shows us to think fondly of our ancestors, to remember them, and also how much walruses are vital to Inuit peoples. Westerners construe this legend into a horror story about the dead, but that is a matter of perspective. You might think it morbid, but it is comforting to the Inuit people. Many stories have been twisted by Western ideology so that they become new stories altogether. However, it is important to look at legends through the eyes of their origin communities and not just your own. The aurora lights are a beautiful phenomenon that many people clamor to view, but they are also a source of hope and light, especially in the northern regions where the nighttime can sometimes seem endless.
