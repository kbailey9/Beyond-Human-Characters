## About the Project

This collection of narratives was designed to explain relational ontologies and how all entities on Earth are connected.

These stories are only a sample of the environment's role in our worldly perspectives. I encourage you to research even more narratives and see how they impact your life.

The images, videos, music, and text is all inspired by academic readings about relational perspectives and use public sources and educationally avilable materials to provide examples.
