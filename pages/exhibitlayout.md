## Physical Exhibit Layout

The physical version of Beyond Human Characters would be much more engaging. The individual stories would surround a main building. The main building would have a large tree and the World Tree story. Then the exhibits would move to the right. The order is from the lowest to the highest environmental element. So the order is Cenotes, The Djinn Desert, the Bluestones, the Baobab Tree, The Aokigahara Forest, The Devil's Tower, Lysa Hora, Mount Vesuvius, and the Aurora Borealis. Then, the audience would end up in a final room that talks about how stories are still being created and use. This area and the open world tree area would have room for guest speakers. Additionally, inbetween the exhibit rooms would be a natural habitat. In the exhibits, there would be a large panel of the story, then smaller images and displays of the evidence. The rooms would also utilize technology to create an ambiance of the story's location. The rooms would be quite open to encourage exploration and have skylights to bring in the natural elements alongside the artifical elements. 

This layout was designed in the Sims 4 as a very basic mock-up.
