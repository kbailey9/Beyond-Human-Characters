## Mount Vesuvius

Many have heard the history of Pompeii and its destruction by Mount Vesuvius. However, did you know that it wasnâ€™t Mount Vesuvius that erupted? No, there was a much larger volcano called Mount Somma. The only visible remnants of this volcano are a ring that surrounds the current Mount Vesuvius. The volcano was renamed after the eruption in 79 AD that drove Pompeii to ruins. The legend goes that the Roman god of fire, forges, metalworking, and volcanoes, Vulcan, was a well-worshipped figure in the region. They even had a festival devoted to him called Vulcanalia. Many Romans attributed fire and volcanic disasters to his doing. It is said that the eruption of Mount Somma was on the day after Vulcanalia, and that Vulcan was displeased, so his anger caused the volcano to destroy the offending Romans. The volcano was then given the name Mount Vesuvius to honor and appease the fire god. The volcano has actually erupted several times since Pompeii, but people are still drawn to the site in fascination. Mount Vesuvius is one of those classic tales where people attach divine explanations for catastrophic events. It allows people to place blame and find a culprit, and eventually leads them to move on. Mount Vesuvius was simply so devastating that it was immortalized in fiery anger. Would you journey up Mount Vesuvius to face Vulcan? Or do you control your actions not to displease the god and heed the volcano's warning?
