## The Baobab Tree

The Baobab Tree is present in Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. It looks a little funny, almost as if it were planted upside down with its roots sticking up in the air. There are many versions of its folklore, many having a first recorded date around 1300 AD. One is that the god Thora didn’t like the Baobab Tree growing in his garden, so he threw it out onto the Earth below. And the tree landed upside down. Another states that the Baobab Tree refused to stay planted, so god picked it up and planted it upside down so it couldn’t move anymore. Another says that when the animals were helping god plant trees, the hyena was given the Baobab tree, and he was disgusted by it, so he simply shoved it into the ground upside down. A final story states that the Baobab Tree was so upset by its own appearance in comparison to the other trees. It wasn’t slim like the palms or had beautiful flowers like the Flame Tree. God became so annoyed by the Baobab Tree’s complaining that he yanked it from the ground and planted it upside down. Therefore, the tree would remain silent and pay off its transgression by being quietly helpful to communities. The baobab tree has remarkable utility. Its fruit is a super-ingredient with many nutrients, and its bark and pods can be made into tools. In a location that does not have many other resources, the baobab tree is a vital source. Additionally, their large statue provides a home to many creatures. The story shows that even if it looks unassuming, it is the most important tree in the region. It teaches us to value our natural capabilities. So, next time you see a Baobab Tree, remind it of its importance and thank it for its resources.
