## Cenotes

Cenotes are sinkholes of fresh water in the Yucatan Peninsula, and they play an important role in the ecosystem in addition to human civilization. Cenotes were the primary water supply for Mayan peoples in the northern Yucatan. With no other sources, the population was completely dependent on the sinkholes. Being such a vital necessity, they placed a lot of importance on cenotes. The religious folklore about cenotes has a first record date of about 150 AD. In Mayan beliefs, cenotes are the physical manifestations of the gateway to the Mayan underworld, Xibalba. There are many stories of heroes and gods traversing the waters to find their goal. While life springs forth from cenotes, they also end in cenotes. Many rituals have been held in the sinkholes, and there are still cultural ceremonies conducted today in the cenotes of the Yucatan. This allows for a connection to their ancestors, but also keeps the stories of the Maya alive. These cenotes are still a vital part of the ecosystem and provide life-giving waters to those who respect them. What would you do if you lived somewhere where water is extremely scarce? Maybe that is already your reality. Look at how much water impacts your life and how necessary it is. Attaching a powerful narrative to water also gives it the respect it deserves as such a substantial force.
