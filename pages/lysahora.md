## Lysa Hora

Lysa Hora, also known as Bald Mountain, is one of the hills that surround the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. It is unusual because despite its non-assuming height, its cap to devoid of trees. It is famous for its dark history, like satanic worship and an old fort that conducted political executions. The current renditions of the legends are relatively recent to around 1830 AD. However, there are older legends attached to the area. One of them, from Slavic beliefs, is of the Witches’ Sabbath on Walpurgis Night. It is said that witches would gather on the treeless summit to conduct rituals at night. They would be joined by crows, eagles, and other paranormal creatures in their ceremonies. Even Disney’s Fantasia has a scene inspired by the tale of the Bald Mountain. This ancient folklore is one of many that casts a veil of darkness over the hill of Lysa Hora. Occultism is strong in the Ukrainian culture, as it is in many cultures. It is a way to explain the unexplainable. But this story, too, has a warning: Beware the hills at night. Beyond superstition, it is important to be aware of your surroundings and know that more than just humans live on Earth. Lysa Hora’s unusual appearance inspired a dark tale, and the setting just wouldn’t be the same without it. Would you venture out on Walpurgis Night to the Bald Mountain?
