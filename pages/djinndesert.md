## The Djinn Desert

The Djinn desert is the homeland of spirits in pre-Islamic Arab cultures. Djinn are beings of natural force, often associated with fire and smoke. Some believe they are malevolent and evil, while some believe they can be good. Many renditions show Djinn as neutral beings whose actions are derived from their own choices, neither good nor evil. They are impacted by their surrounding energies. Westerners changed the original stories of the Djinn into wish-granting genies who live in lamps or bottles. But all of these renditions relate to the desert as a challenging force. Djinns reside in desolate corners of deserts and unclean places. For those who travel the desert, it becomes an obstacle and a rite of passage. Fires, sandstorms, mirages, and more are deadly encounters in the desolate landscape. If you can come out alive, you have the power to make change. Whether that is through your own actions after facing off against a Djinn or through the actions of your wish-granting genie. The Rig-e Jenn, or Dune of the Jinn, is a desert in Iran where folklore specifically states that the dunes are governed by the Jinn. It has a first record date of about 4000 BC. While the folklore also exists in Arabian deserts, the Rig-e Jenn is a desert steeped in myth. Many people still traverse the desert today and face the Djinnsâ€™ powers. The desert is an extreme environment, and only those who have adapted to the harsh conditions survive. Could you survive the Djinn Desert? Or, do the stories provide enough warning to steer you away, like they are supposed to?
