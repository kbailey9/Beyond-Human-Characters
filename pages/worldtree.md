## The World Tree

Let’s start off with the World Tree. The World Tree is a story concept featured in many cultural beliefs and narratives. It can be called the Tree of Knowledge or the Tree of Life, among many other names. One main constant of the World Tree is that it is the center of life. Whether that means it reaches up to heaven and down to hell, branches out to the nine realms, and is the origin of terrestrial life, the tree is a symbol of life in stories. The tree represents the source of life, a connection between all life, and the cycle of life and death. The narratives also feature guardians of the tree and fruit that give immortality. In many renditions, the tree is a connection between the sacred and the profane. The Norse version of the World Tree has a first record date of about 1200 AD.

This symbol of connections is the start of the exhibit, exactly because it is synonymous with relationality. All life is connected, and many of the narratives about the tree feature more-than-human characters. They are outside our understanding and mighty forces all their own. Think about the tree branches. Each one has their own world, their own stories, their own characters. Yet, they all connect back to the World Tree. So, as you move through this exhibit, think about the stories in their own context, but also look at how they are connected. In the end, I hope you’ve broadened your understanding of folklore and think about how much the environment impacts our perspectives.
